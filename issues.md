When submitting an issue:
- follow the structure laid out in the templates to the best of your ability.
- A ticket should be able to be read by any dev and understand what needs to be done without extra questions.
- Assign only 1 of each label category EXECPT for `Priority` and `Reply` which are only for Senior Devs and Execs
- Do NOT assign anyone to a ticket
- Always make sure a ticket doesn't already exist
